# TODO

* update the favicon
  - just make it a D
  
* separate 'pages' from 'articles'
 - so that I can create a 'concepts' page which i link to in the header and which doesn't show up in the articles list

* create a 'concepts' page
 - a.k.a. 'terminology' page
 - for things like 'discriminative learning rates'
 - and clr: 'cyclical learning rates'
 - broken out into sections - section on loss functions, models, etc.

* add search with autocomplete

* add an image thumbnail to each blog article
 - so I can quickly scan for the paper I want to go back to from the homepage
